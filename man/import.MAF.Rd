\usage{
import.MAF(file, sep = "\\t", is.TCGA = TRUE, filter.fun = NULL,
  to.TRONCO = TRUE, irregular = FALSE, paste.to.Hugo_Symbol = NULL,
  merge.mutation.types = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{MAF filename}

\item{sep}{MAF separator, default \'\\t\'}

\item{is.TCGA}{TRUE if this MAF is from TCGA; thus its sample codenames can be interpreted}

\item{filter.fun}{A filter function applied to each row. This is expected to return TRUE/FALSE.}

\item{to.TRONCO}{If FALSE returns a dataframe with MAF data, not a TRONCO object}

\item{irregular}{If TRUE seeks only for columns Hugo_Symbol, Tumor_Sample_Barcode and Variant_Classification}

\item{paste.to.Hugo_Symbol}{If a list of column names, this will be pasted each Hugo_Symbol to yield names such as PHC2.chr1.33116215.33116215}

\item{merge.mutation.types}{If TRUE, all mutations are considered equivalent, regardless of their Variant_Classification value. Otherwise no.}
}
\value{
A TRONCO compliant representation of the input MAF
}
\description{
Import mutation profiles from a Manual Annotation Format (MAF) file. All mutations are aggregated as a
unique event type labeled "Mutation" and assigned a color according to the default of function
\code{import.genotypes}. If this is a TCGA MAF file check for multiple samples per patient is performed
and a warning is raised if these occurr. Customized MAF files can be imported as well provided that 
they have columns Hugo_Symbol, Tumor_Sample_Barcode and Variant_Classification. 
Custom filters are possible (via filter.fun) to avoid loading the full MAF data
}
\examples{
data(maf)
mutations = import.MAF(maf)
mutations = annotate.description(mutations, 'Example MAF')
mutations = TCGA.shorten.barcodes(mutations)
oncoprint(mutations)
