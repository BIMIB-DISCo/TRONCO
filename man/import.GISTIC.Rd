\title{import.GISTIC}
\usage{
import.GISTIC(x, filter.genes = NULL, filter.samples = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Either a dataframe or a filename}

\item{filter.genes}{A list of genes}

\item{filter.samples}{A list of samples}
}
\value{
A TRONCO compliant representation of the input CNAs.
}
\description{
Transform GISTIC scores for CNAs in a TRONCO compliant object. Input can be either a matrix, with columns
for each altered gene and rows for each sample; in this case colnames/rownames mut be provided. If input
is a character an attempt to load a table from file is performed. In this case the input table format
should be constitent with TCGA data for focal CNA; there should hence be: one column for each sample,
one row for each gene, a column Hugo_Symbol with every gene name and a column Entrez_Gene_Id with every
 gene\'s Entrez ID. A valid GISTIC score should be any value of: "Homozygous Loss" (-2), "Heterozygous
 Loss" (-1), "Low-level Gain" (+1), "High-level Gain" (+2).
