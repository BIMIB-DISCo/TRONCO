\description{
\code{types.add} sets a global data frame 'types' that contains all types defined.  Types can be added and refined incrementally, in any order.
}
\details{
\code{types.add} defines a type of event considered  at a time. If the type was previously defined, its definition is updated to keep track of its last definition. A consistency check is performed to ensure that the type is valid. Types must be defined before events are loaded.
}
\examples{
types.add("gain", "red")
}
