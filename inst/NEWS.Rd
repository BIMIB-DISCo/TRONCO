\section{Changes in Version 2.0.0}{
    \itemize{
        \item Released in summer 2015 on our GitHUB, will replace the

        such as GISTIC (for Copy Number Variants), MAF (for mutations' annotation),
        supports TCGA samples editing and queries to the CBio portal.
        This version comes with new plotting capabilities, and a general
        from-scratch design. It is not compatible with previous releases.
