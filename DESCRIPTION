Name: 
    An R package for the inference of cancer progression models from heterogeneous genomic data
Description:
    TRONCO is a R package which collects algorithms to infer progression models from 
    Bernoulli 0/1 profiles of genomic alterations across a tumor sample. 
    Such profiles are usually visualized as a binary input matrix where each row 
    represents a patient’s sample (e.g., the result of a sequenced tumor biopsy), and 
    each column an event relevant to the progression (a certain type of somatic mutation, 
    a focal or higher-level chromosomal copy number alteration, etc.); a 0/1 value models 
    the absence/presence of that alteration in the sample. 
    In this version of TRONCO such profiles can be readily imported by boolean matrices 
    and MAF or GISTIC files. The package provides various functions to editing, visualize 
    and subset such data, as well as functions to query the cBioPortal for cancer genomics. 
    In the current version, TRONCO provides parallel implementations of CAPRESE  
    [PLoS ONE 9(12): e115570] and CAPRI [Bioinformatics, doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btv296] 
    algorithms to infer progression models arranged as trees or general direct acyclic 
    graphs. Bootstrap procedures to assess the non-prametric and statistical confidence 
    of the inferred models are also provided. The package comes with example data 
    available, which include the dataset of Atypical Chronic Myeloid Leukemia samples by 
    Piazza et al., Nat. Genet., 45 (2013).
