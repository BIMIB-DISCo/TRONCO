Description: Genotype-level cancer progression models describe the ordering of
    accumulating mutations, e.g., somatic mutations / copy number variations,
    during cancer development. These graphical models help understand the
    causal structure involving events promoting cancer progression, possibly
    predicting complex patterns characterising genomic progression of a cancer.
    Reconstructed models can be used to better characterise genotype-phenotype
    relation, and suggest novel targets for therapy design. TRONCO
    (TRanslational ONCOlogy) is a R package aimed at collecting
    state-of-the-art algorithms to infer progression models from
    cross-sectional data, i.e., data collected from independent patients which
    does not necessarily incorporate any evident temporal information. These
    algorithms require a binary input matrix where: (i) each row represents a
    patient genome, (ii) each column an event relevant to the progression (a
    priori selected) and a 0/1 value models the absence/presence of a certain
    mutation in a certain patient. The current first version of TRONCO
    implements the CAPRESE algorithm (Cancer PRogression Extraction with Single
    Edges) to infer possible progression models arranged as trees; cfr.

    shows how to use TRONCO to infer a tree model of ovarian cancer progression
    from CGH data of copy number alterations (classified as gains or losses
    over chromosome's arms). The dataset used is available in the SKY/M-FISH
    database.
